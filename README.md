# Rust Real-Time Chat Room
The Rust Real-Time Chat Room is a terminal-based chat application built using Tokio (Rust's asynchronous runtime) and Ratatui (a Rust TUI library). It allows real-time messaging through a terminal, which is available on every computer. The application uses TCP streams to transmit chat messages and system events efficiently.
